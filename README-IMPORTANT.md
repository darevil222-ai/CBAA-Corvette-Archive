## What this is

This is **not** a mod pack.  
This is **not** a balance project.  
This is **not** a tutorial repository.

This is a **foundry archive** containing:
- fully constructed corvette builds
- exported ship data (`.json`)
- technical descriptions and release notes
- reference screenshots

All ships are:
- designed as **intentional overbuilds**
- created for **specific roles**, not aesthetics alone
- released *as-is*, without guarantees of balance or compatibility
