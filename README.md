# CBAA – Corvette Foundry

Unofficial public archive of custom-built **No Man’s Sky corvettes**  
designed and released by **Crimson Bureau of Advanced Architecture (CBAA)**.

This repository exists as a **controlled data leak** and experimental archive.
Use it responsibly.

---

## What this is

This is **not** a mod pack.  
This is **not** a balance project.  
This is **not** a tutorial repository.

This is a **foundry archive** containing:
- fully constructed corvette builds
- exported ship data (`.json`)
- technical descriptions and release notes
- reference screenshots

All ships are:
- designed as **intentional overbuilds**
- created for **specific roles**, not aesthetics alone
- released *as-is*, without guarantees of balance or compatibility

---

Each build inside `/BUILDS/` follows a **strict, identical structure**:
- one JSON file with "Base" data - so construction data, and one JSON with Ship data - so what is placed in inventory, what technologies are installed, and supercharged slots
- one build-specific README
- optional screenshots

---

## Builds

Released builds are organized chronologically and identified by **Build Number**. Each is S klas with 120 inventory slots, and fully unlocked Tech slots with 4 charged slots.
Build numbers are **final**.  
Once released, a build is never overwritten — only superseded.

---

## Importing Ships

These builds are provided as **raw ship data exports**.

General process:
1. **Backup your save** (mandatory).
2. Use a compatible **No Man’s Sky save editor**.
3. Import the provided `.json` files.
4. Verify ship ownership and slot assignment.

Exact behavior depends on:
- game version
- save editor
- expedition state

You are responsible for your own self-integrity.

## Design Philosophy (Short Version)

CBAA ships are built under the assumption that:
- intimidation **is** a feature
- asymmetry is acceptable if functional
- excess mass, armor, and firepower are deliberate choices
- Not every ship is meant to be liked

If you are looking for elegance or meta efficiency —  
This archive is probably **not** for you.

## Final Note

These ships were not designed to be reasonable.  
They were designed to exist.

Proceed accordingly.
